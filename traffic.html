      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px;">This chart comes from LTPP's "TST_L05B" table, which contains data from field and laboratory measurements on
          material type and thicknesses of the pavement structure layers. The 8 types of classified layers are:
          Asphalt concrete layer, Bound (treated) base, Bound (treated) subbase, Engineering Fabric, Portland cement
          concrete layer, Subgrade (untreated), Unbound (granular) base, and Unbound (granular) subbase. For combined
          layers, the upper-most layer is used. For example, on some AC-surfaced sections with asphalt treated base layers,
          the combined  layer may be represented as AC. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px;">As can be seen, asphalt-concrete layer, typically the surface layer, is the most studied layer, and accounts for
          39% of all studied road sections, followed by untreated subgrade layer and unbound granular base layer.
          This can be explained by likelihood that rarely are base layers accessed during repair. </p>

      <br><br>
      <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
        We investigated road section crack lengths by state. "Crack Length" is the reinterpreted cracking data for
        asphalt-concrete surface pavements based on formulas in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide.
        This graph shows the average surface layer crack length for each state. Based on analysis, we found it interesting
        that the Midwest States -- North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Indiana, and Wyoming-- seem to have the
        highest average crack length. Intuitively, this makes sense as those states experience harsh winters. </p>

      <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>

   <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
    We wanted to explore the relationship between the age of the road and the crack length on its surface.
     We combined multiple databases and identified 54 road sections that were measured for crack length in 2019 which
     also had information on the age of its pavement. Although some older pavements have long crack length, and certain
     newer pavement have shorter crack length, the correlation is not distinctively obvious. </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>This may be because an older road received upgrades that we are not aware of. </p>

   <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
    Next, we attempted to examine the correlation between a road section's representation thickness and its crack length.
    After having performed the analysis above, we realized that we cannot draw conclusions on representative thickness and
    crack length.</P>

    <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
    Representative thickness is a measure of the test section's thickness at a specific layer, this could be the surface
    layer, the base, or the sub-base. Whereas the the crack length is only measured at the topmost layer of pavement. </p>

    <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
    Further, the samples of thickness and samples and crack length were collected at different times. If a road section's
    sub base layer is measured at 20.5 mm in 2005, and surface crack length is measured to be 16" in 2007, we cannot draw
    any conclusions between the two sets of data.</P>

    <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
    This is another example of LTPP's large collection of inconsistent, and uncorrelated data.

      <p style='text-align: justify;margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>Equivalent single-axle load (ESAL) is the unit used to measure the effects of axle loads on pavement. </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify;margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>
        By convention, an 18,000-pound single axle is 1.00 ESAL. 1 KESAL is 1,000 ESAL. The KESAL chart comes from LTPP's
        TRF_ESAL_COMPUTED table, which captures the estimated axle load a lane section experiences in the given year based
        on traffic monitoring measurements computed using the 1993 AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures methodolog
        Data is available for all 50 states, ranging from 1990 to 2019, although not every State collects data every year. </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify;margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'> Our analysis shows, on average, states with the heaviest traffic are: Georgia, Arkansas, and Oregon, which is a bit
        surprising because none of these states has a particularly large population. Upon a closer look, we realized that
        only 6 years of data are available for Georgia. Since the middle of the year range has more data, we took a closer
        look at the year 2000, which shows the states with the most traffic are: Indiana, Oregon, and Pennsylvia. Oregon was
        again among the top 3 in both sample sets, which begs a closer analysis. </p>
      <p style='text-align: justify;margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'>

  <p style='text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;'> We took a closer at datasets for Oregon, Arkansas, and California.
    We noticed between 1992- 2006, average traffic
    in Oregon rose steadily and ranked very high nationally. No data is available between 2006-2017, and by 2018, when data
    is collected again, the traffic measured has significantly dropped. This may be because not all roads in Oregon were
    tested between 2018 and 2019. Other possible explanations could be that the road sections measured are federal highways.
    It is possible that new federal or state highways are built to alleviate traffic. </p>

        We wanted to see what traffic load for Hawaii looked like. During data processing, we realized that there are only
        4 test sections in the state of Hawaii: 2 on Big Island, and 2 on Maui. The two test sections on Maui are so closely
        located they are practically the same section. Further, not every road section is sampled every year.
        That said, the sample size of test sections in Hawaii is too small to make definitive conclusions.
